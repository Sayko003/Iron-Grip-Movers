                <h2 class="h2 article--title">Start Early (Earlier Than You Think)</h2>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">The biggest mistake people make? Waiting too long to get started. As soon as you know you’re moving, begin preparing. Even if you don’t have an exact date yet, you can start with the basics—sorting, decluttering, and planning.</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Pro tip: Create a moving timeline with weekly goals. Break down what needs to happen by when—booking movers, getting boxes, packing certain rooms, changing addresses, etc.</p>

                <h2 class="h2 article--title">Declutter Before You Pack</h2>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Why pack what you don’t need? Moving is the perfect excuse to finally say goodbye to those old cords, clothes that don’t fit, or the “just in case” kitchen gadgets you haven’t touched in years.</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Go room by room. Make four piles: keep, donate, sell, and toss. Be ruthless. Less stuff = fewer boxes = less stress on moving day.</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">If you're feeling ambitious, host a yard sale or post items online. Extra cash never hurts when you're moving!</p>

                <p class="text-main article--descr">Why pack what you don’t need? Moving is the perfect excuse to finally say goodbye to those old cords, clothes that don’t fit, or the “just in case” kitchen gadgets you haven’t touched in years.</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Pro tip: Consider buying specialty boxes for TVs, wardrobe items, dishes, or artwork. They make a big difference when it comes to protecting fragile or odd-shaped items.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="article--item">
                <h2 class="h2 article--title">Label Like a Pro</h2>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">A box labeled “kitchen” doesn’t tell you much. Be specific: “Kitchen – pots & pans – lower cabinet.” Use color-coded tape or markers for each room to make sorting easier at the new place.</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">And don’t forget to label boxes with <strong>“fragile”</strong> or <strong>“this side up”</strong> when needed.</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Also handy: a “first night” box with essentials like toilet paper, chargers, snacks, soap, a change of clothes, and a coffee maker. Thank yourself later.</p>

                <h2 class="h2 article--title">Book Your Moving Company Early</h2>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Movers get booked up fast—especially during weekends, holidays, or the end of the month. Don’t leave it to chance. Research companies, read reviews, and ask about insurance and licensing.</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Know what services you want: just loading and transport? Or full packing and unpacking? Be clear about the size of the move and any special needs like stairs, tight hallways, or delicate items.</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Bonus tip: If you're moving from cities like Austin or Boston, local crews familiar with the layout and traffic can save you serious time.</p>

                <h2 class="h2 article--title">Take Care of Utilities and Address Changes</h2>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Notify utility providers of your move and schedule disconnections or transfers. Do this at least two weeks in advance. You don’t want to spend your first night in the dark—or get billed for someone else’s usage</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Update your address with the post office, banks, subscription services, insurance companies, and anything else tied to your mailing address.</p>

            <li class="article--item">
                <h2 class="h2 article--title">Protect Your Valuables and Important Documents</h2>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Keep jewelry, passports, birth certificates, and other sensitive documents with you—not in the moving truck. Place them in a clearly marked folder or small bag that stays in your possession during the move.</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Take photos of expensive items (furniture, electronics, etc.) in case you need to file a damage claim later.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="article--item">
                <h2 class="h2 article--title">Pack Room by Room, Zone by Zone</h2>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Trying to pack everything at once leads to chaos. Focus on one room or section at a time. Start with storage spaces, guest rooms, and anything you don’t use daily. Save kitchen and bathroom essentials for last.</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Packing in zones also makes unpacking way easier when you arrive.</p>

                <h2 class="h2 article--title">Confirm Everything Before Moving Day</h2>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">A few days before the move, call to confirm with your moving company. Double-check addresses, time of arrival, parking availability, and final costs.</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Also, confirm elevator reservations or loading dock access if you're moving in or out of an apartment or commercial building.</p>
            </li>

                <h2 class="h2 article--title">Take a Deep Breath (You’ve Got This)</h2>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">Moving is a lot. But with a plan, good organization, and some flexibility, it doesn’t have to be a nightmare. Prepare early, stay ahead of the mess, and don’t be afraid to ask for help—from friends, family, or professional movers.</p>
                <p class="text-main article--descr">A smooth move starts with smart prep. And the reward? A fresh start in a new space you get to call home.</p>
