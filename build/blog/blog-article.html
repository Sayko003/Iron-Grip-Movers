				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					The biggest mistake people make? Waiting too long to&#160;get started. As&#160;soon as&#160;you know you&#8217;re moving, begin preparing. Even if&#160;you
					don&#8217;t have an&#160;exact date yet, you can start with the basics&#8212;sorting, decluttering, and planning.
				</p>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Pro tip: Create a&#160;moving timeline with weekly goals. Break down what needs to&#160;happen by&#160;when&#8212;booking movers, getting boxes, packing certain
					rooms, changing addresses, etc.

				<h2 class="h2 article--title">Declutter Before You Pack</h2>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Why pack what you don&#8217;t need? Moving is&#160;the perfect excuse to&#160;finally say goodbye to&#160;those old cords, clothes that don&#8217;t fit,
					or&#160;the &#171;just in&#160;case&#187; kitchen gadgets you haven&#8217;t touched in&#160;years.
				</p>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Go&#160;room by&#160;room. Make four piles: keep, donate, sell, and toss. Be&#160;ruthless. Less stuff = fewer boxes = less stress on&#160;moving day.
				</p>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					If&#160;you&#8217;re feeling ambitious, host a&#160;yard sale or&#160;post items online. Extra cash never hurts when you&#8217;re moving!

					Why pack what you don&#8217;t need? Moving is&#160;the perfect excuse to&#160;finally say goodbye to&#160;those old cords, clothes that don&#8217;t fit,
					or&#160;the &#171;just in&#160;case&#187; kitchen gadgets you haven&#8217;t touched in&#160;years.
				</p>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Pro tip: Consider buying specialty boxes for TVs, wardrobe items, dishes, or&#160;artwork. They make a&#160;big difference when it&#160;comes to&#160;protecting
					fragile or&#160;odd-shaped items.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li class="article--item">
				<h2 class="h2 article--title">Label Like a&#160;Pro</h2>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					A&#160;box labeled &#171;kitchen&#187; doesn&#8217;t tell you much. Be&#160;specific: &#171;Kitchen&#160;&#8212; pots & pans&#160;&#8212; lower cabinet.&#187; Use
					color-coded tape or&#160;markers for each room to&#160;make sorting easier at&#160;the new place.
				</p>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					And don&#8217;t forget to&#160;label boxes with <strong>&#171;fragile&#187;</strong> or&#160;<strong>&#171;this side up&#187;</strong> when needed.
				</p>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Also handy: a&#160;&#171;first night&#187; box with essentials like toilet paper, chargers, snacks, soap, a&#160;change of&#160;clothes, and a&#160;coffee maker.
					Thank yourself later.

				<h2 class="h2 article--title">Book Your Moving Company Early</h2>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Movers get booked up&#160;fast&#8212;especially during weekends, holidays, or&#160;the end of&#160;the month. Don&#8217;t leave it&#160;to&#160;chance. Research
					companies, read reviews, and ask about insurance and licensing.
				</p>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Know what services you want: just loading and transport? Or&#160;full packing and unpacking? Be&#160;clear about the size of&#160;the move and any special needs
					like stairs, tight hallways, or&#160;delicate items.
				</p>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Bonus tip: If&#160;you&#8217;re moving from cities like Austin or&#160;Boston, local crews familiar with the layout and traffic can save you serious time.
				</p>

			<li class="article--item">
				<h2 class="h2 article--title">Take Care of&#160;Utilities and Address Changes</h2>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Notify utility providers of&#160;your move and schedule disconnections or&#160;transfers. Do&#160;this at&#160;least two weeks in&#160;advance. You don&#8217;t
					want to&#160;spend your first night in&#160;the dark&#8212;or get billed for someone else&#8217;s usage
				</p>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Update your address with the post office, banks, subscription services, insurance companies, and anything else tied to&#160;your mailing address.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li class="article--item">
				<h2 class="h2 article--title">Protect Your Valuables and Important Documents</h2>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Keep jewelry, passports, birth certificates, and other sensitive documents with you&#8212;not in&#160;the moving truck. Place them in&#160;a&#160;clearly marked
					folder or&#160;small bag that stays in&#160;your possession during the move.
				</p>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Take photos of&#160;expensive items (furniture, electronics, etc.) in&#160;case you need to&#160;file a&#160;damage claim later.
				</p>

			<li class="article--item">
				<h2 class="h2 article--title">Pack Room by&#160;Room, Zone by&#160;Zone</h2>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Trying to&#160;pack everything at&#160;once leads to&#160;chaos. Focus on&#160;one room or&#160;section at&#160;a&#160;time. Start with storage spaces, guest
					rooms, and anything you don&#8217;t use daily. Save kitchen and bathroom essentials for last.
				</p>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">Packing in&#160;zones also makes unpacking way easier when you arrive.</p>
			</li>

			<li class="article--item">
				<h2 class="h2 article--title">Confirm Everything Before Moving Day</h2>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					A&#160;few days before the move, call to&#160;confirm with your moving company. Double-check addresses, time of&#160;arrival, parking availability, and final
					costs.
				</p>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Also, confirm elevator reservations or&#160;loading dock access if&#160;you&#8217;re moving in&#160;or&#160;out of&#160;an&#160;apartment or&#160;commercial
					building.

				<h2 class="h2 article--title">Take a&#160;Deep Breath (You&#8217;ve Got This)</h2>
				<p class="text-main article--descr">
					Moving is&#160;a&#160;lot. But with a&#160;plan, good organization, and some flexibility, it&#160;doesn&#8217;t have to&#160;be&#160;a&#160;nightmare. Prepare
					early, stay ahead of&#160;the mess, and don&#8217;t be&#160;afraid to&#160;ask for help&#8212;from friends, family, or&#160;professional movers.
				</p>

					A&#160;smooth move starts with smart prep. And the reward? A&#160;fresh start in&#160;a&#160;new space you get to&#160;call home.
